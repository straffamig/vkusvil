#### Description:
My project is meal constructor that makes mono (5 ingridients) and complicated (over 10 ingridient) products sold at ready to eat meals in a Moscow's groceries store. Ingridients will be local. I felt inspired to implement this idea in my project after eating chicken patties with mozarella and red bull pepper center and kinoa, carrot, pepper, bulgur as side dish. I think this groceries store is using software to come up with such complex ideas for meals. Some ingridients cannot match.
